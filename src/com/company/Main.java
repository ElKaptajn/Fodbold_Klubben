/**
 * 2. Make a main that produces a menu with options to create new players/members as objects, list all members/players in a sorted list, search for a player, delete a player or search for all the players on the first or second team / or within an age interval.
 * 3. Create all the methods.
 * 4. Make the appropriate files and the code to handle the reading and writing to and from files.
 * 5. Create 30 members/players in random order, you have to variate age (between 10 - 35), first-/second team.
 * 6. Test that all the functionality works!
 * 7. Make it possible for the user to choose which field the list should be sorted by.
